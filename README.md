## Installation

TSFuse requires Python 3, NumPy, and Cython:

    pip install numpy cython
    
The latest release can be installed using pip:

    pip install tsfuse
    
## Quickstart

The example below shows the basic usage of TSFuse.

### Data format

The input of TSFuse is a dataset where each instance is a window that consists of multiple time series and a label.

#### Time series

Time series are represented using a dictionary where each entry represents a univariate or multivariate time series. As an example, let's create a dictionary with two univariate time series:

```python
from pandas import DataFrame
from tsfuse.data import Collection
X = {
    "x1": Collection(pd.DataFrame({
        'id':   [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3],
        'time': [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2],
        'data': [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1],
    })),
    "x2": Collection(pd.DataFrame({
        'id':   [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3],
        'time': [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2],
        'data': [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3],
    })),
}
```

The two univariate time series are named `x1` and `x2` and each series is represented as a `Collection` object. Each ``Collection`` is initialized with a DataFrame that has three columns:

- `id` which is the identifier of each instance, i.e., each window,
- `time` which contains the time stamps,
- `data` contains the time series data itself.

For multivariate time series data, there can be multiple columns similar to the `data` column. For example, the data of a tri-axial accelerometer would have three columns `x`, `y`, `z` instead of `data` as it simultaneously measures the `x`, `y`, `z` acceleration.

#### Labels

There should be one target value for each window, so we create a `Series` where the index contains all unique `id` values of the time series data and the data consists of the labels:

```python
from pandas import Series
y = Series(index=[0, 1, 2, 3], data=[0, 0, 1, 1])
```

### Feature construction

To construct features, TSFuse provides a `construct` function which takes time series data `X` and target data `y` as input, and returns a `DataFrame` where each column corresponds to a feature. In addition, this function can return a computation graph which contains all transformation steps required to compute the features for new data:

```python
from tsfuse import construct
features, graph = construct(X, y, transformers="minimal", return_graph=True)
```

To apply this computation graph to new data, simply call `transform` with a time series dictionary `X` as input:

```python
features = graph.transform(X)
```
